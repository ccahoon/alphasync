A desktop file manager for AlphaSmart NEO laptop devices connected to a Mac.

This is an alternative to the Neo Manager software from renaissance learning or to using the Neo's
keyboard emulation to transfer text files. It has the following advantages over Neo Manager:

- single-key backup of all text data (including named files, which are not accessible to Neo Manager)
- drag-and-drop text files to/from the Neo
- optional automatic application launch when a Neo device is connected to the host Mac
- automatic text conversion to/from MacASCII, UTF8 or UTF16 file formats

The application contains a build-in user-mode USB driver, requiring no driver install.

It is compatible with all Intel Macintosh computers, including systems running OS 10.9 ("Mavericks").

The project file require Xcode 4.6.3 or later.
