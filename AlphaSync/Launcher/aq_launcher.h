 *
 *  The launcher API is intended to be used with an auxillary application, typically bundled in the main
 *  application's resource directory. The auxillary application can be installed to run at login and
 *  can be configured to start the main application when a particular USB device is connected.
 *
 *  The basic API methods are:
 *
 *      aq_LauncherOpen()       --  Open a new session and check that the specified launcher application exists
 *      aq_LauncherClose()      --  Close the session
 *
 *      aq_LauncherIsInstalled()    --  Check if the launcher is currently installed
 *      aq_LauncherInstall()        --  Install the launcher in the login items and start it running
 *      aq_LauncherUninstall()      --  Remove the launcher from the login items and stop any existing instance running
 *
 *      aq_LauncherGetFirstLaunchItem() --  Enumeration (first item)
 *      aq_LauncherGetNextLaunchItem()  --  Enumeration (next items)
 *      aq_LauncherAddLaunchItem()      --  Add an item to launch on connection of a device
 *      aq_LauncherClearLaunchItems()   --  Clear all launch items
 *      aq_LauncherDeleteLaunchItem()   --  Remove a launch item
 *      aq_LauncherFlushLaunchItems()   --  Flush changes to the launch items and notify the server if it is running
 *
 *  The code uses a passive approach to the server and will not start the launcher application unless it is installed
 *  and is not already running.
