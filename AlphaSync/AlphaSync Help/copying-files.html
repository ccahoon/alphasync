<h3>Copying Files from a Neo to a Mac</h3>

<p>To copy a file from the Neo, click on the file in the main window and drag it either to the destination. Files can be dragged to
the finder window to create a copy on disk, or directly in to an application window (such as Word or Pages) to paste the text
directly in to the application.</p>
<p>Dragging a device or applet name to the finder will create a new folder on your Mac that will contain all of the files
that were dragged.</p>

<h3>Copying Files from a Mac to the Neo</h3>

<p>To copy a file to the Neo, drag the file from the Finder to the AlphaSync main window.</p>
<p>Dragging a file to an Applet icon will attempt to create a new file with a suitable name. These are not
directly bound to one of the File keys on the Neo, but must be opened. When using AlphaWord, type <b><code>cmd-O</code></b>
to open a file copied in this way.</p>
<p>Dragging on to a File icon will attempt to over write the file on the Neo with the new file contents.</p>

<p><b>Only plain ASCII text files may be copied to AlphaWord or to the User Dictionary.</b> To copy files from non-text applications,
such as Microsoft Word, you must first save the file as plain ASCII text (using save-as, and with a ".txt" file extension).</p>
