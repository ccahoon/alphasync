<h1>Character Set Issues</h1>
<hr>

<p>AlphaSync assumes the use of Mac Roman extended ASCII for its text file format. This gives a good compromise
between compatibility with other Mac applications and it works with almost all Neo standard accented characters,
punctuation and currency symbols.</p>

<p>If you find that characters in a file uploaded to the Neo display differently than you expected, check that
the file that you copied to the Neo was in Mac Roman ASCII coding. For example, you can select the encoding
using 'save-as' from within Microsoft Word.</p>
